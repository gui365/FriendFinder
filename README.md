# Friend•Finder App

This project was the homework for week 13 of the Penn Coding Boot Camp.

## Goal
To create a full-stack application using NodeJS, ExpressJS and Heroku (for deployment).

## Installation and Set-up
Make sure to run *npm install* at the root directory after cloning the project. Then in the command line, run either `node server.js` or `npm start`, and direct your browser to `localhost:3000`.
You can also use the deployed version of this app at: https://gbarila-ffinder.herokuapp.com/.

## Functionality
The application consists of a land page (Picture 1) and a survey page (Picture 2) which contains a questionnaire with 10 questions. The user enters his name and a link to his picture, and answers the questions according to how much he agrees/disagrees with each statement. Once the user hits the **Done** button, the information from the form is sent to the server where a calculation is performed, and information is sent back to the client announcing who their best match is (Picture 3).
